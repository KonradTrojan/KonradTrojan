## My microservices project 

Recently, I was part of the startup 'Selfcloud', which was developing an application to support freelancers. I designed the architecture of this application based on clean code principles and microservices patterns.

I created a few microservices that use an internal REST API and Kafka to communicate with each other. Sample projects:

- 🔒 [selfcloud-security](https://github.com/selfcloud-labs/selfcloud-security/tree/dev) - Manages authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to the platform. It handles user logins, token generation, and permissions
- 🌐 [selflcloud-apigateway](https://github.com/selfcloud-labs/selfcloud-apigateway/tree/dev) - Acts as the main gateway, handling external requests and routing them to the appropriate internal microservices. It also provides a unified API interface for the application.
- 📝 [selfcloud-announcement](https://github.com/selfcloud-labs/selfcloud-announcement/tree/dev) - Allows users to create, manage, and display announcements. It also manages the visibility and categorization of announcements across the platform.
- 💬 [selfcloud-chat](https://github.com/selfcloud-labs/selfcloud-chat/tree/main) - Provides real-time messaging functionality for users.
